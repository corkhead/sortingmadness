The tests were designed around a few certain areas of interest.  

Tests 1, 2, 3, 4 are designed to test normal operation of the 4 sorts
Tests 1-2, 2-2, 3-2, 4-2 are designed to test whether an empty line is treated properly by each sort (should be length 0)
Tests 1-3, 2-3, 3-3, 4-3 are designed to test whether a file that declares a sorting type but with no strings to sort are handled properly by each sort

Test 0 is designed to test an invalid sort type (0)
Test 0-1 is designed to test where no sort type is declared in the input
Test 0-2 is designed to test when the file given as input is empty
Test 0-3 is designed to test when the file does not exist
